# Final Fantasy Solo API Project

This solo project was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis (CC) coding bootcamp. 

# Motivation

Having a ton of fun at CC learning full stack development and I'm also a big fan of Final Fantasy. Why not put those 2 things together?

# Getting Started 

This API project requires PostgreSQL to be installed on your local machine. 

How to use the API:

### Initial Set-up

1. Install necessary dependencies by running the following `npm i` and `npm i knex`

2. Start the server with `npm start`

3. Open up `localhost:9999` in your browser

# Build Status and Future Goals

Front end and back end are connected via `express static` and info from the database is displaying in broswer dev console.

Dropdown selection to display correct information is needed to be implemented.
